With this Umbraco CMS package, you can now add a new custom property editor to your uploaded images. This feature enables you to use the focal point of an image to obtain its brightest color, average color, and opposite color to the brightest.

You can then use these colours in your website build to enhance your designs.

<!--
Including screenshots is a really good idea! 

If you put images into /docs/screenshots, then you would reference them in this readme as, for example:

<img alt="..." src="https://github.com/WildSiteCreation/Our.Community.MediaColourFinder/blob/develop/docs/screenshots/screenshot.png">
-->

## Installation

Add the package to an existing Umbraco website (v10.4+) from nuget:
